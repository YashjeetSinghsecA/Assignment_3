The HTML file (index.html) is structured to include sections for:

Authentication using an access code.
Quiz questions and options.
Progress bar to visually represent quiz progression.
Final score display.
CSS Styling

Challenges Faced
Dynamic Element Creation: Creating and manipulating HTML elements dynamically in JavaScript to display quiz questions and options required careful handling of event listeners and DOM manipulation.

Styling and Responsiveness: Ensuring the quiz interface remains visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes while integrating a background video posed challenges in CSS layout and design.

Logic Flow: Managing the flow of the quiz, including question progression, answer validation, and final score display, required meticulous planning to ensure smooth user experience without bugs or interruptions.

Browser Compatibility: Testing across various browsers and ensuring consistent behavior, especially regarding JavaScript functionality like event handling and DOM manipulation, was crucial for cross-browser compatibility.
